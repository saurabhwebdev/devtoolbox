            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What is a Favicon?</h2>
            <p>
              A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small, iconic image that represents a website or web application. 
              Originally introduced by Internet Explorer in 1999, favicons have evolved from simple 16×16 pixel ICO files 
              to a complex system of different sizes and formats serving various purposes across platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, favicons serve many functions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Identifying your site in browser tabs</li>
              <li>Making your site recognizable in bookmarks and history</li>
              <li>Creating app icons when users add your site to their home screen</li>
              <li>Displaying your brand in app switchers when running as a PWA</li>
              <li>Providing visual identity in RSS feeds and social sharing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Favicons Matter</h2>
            <p>
              In today's crowded digital landscape, brand recognition is crucial. Favicons might be small, but they play a 
              significant role in establishing and reinforcing your brand identity. Here's why they're important:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> Users can quickly identify your site among dozens of open tabs or bookmarks</li>
              <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Websites without favicons appear unfinished or unprofessional</li>
              <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> They help users navigate between multiple open tabs more effectively</li>
              <li><strong>Brand Consistency:</strong> They reinforce your visual identity across platforms</li>
              <li><strong>PWA Requirements:</strong> Proper icons are essential for Progressive Web Apps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Studies show that users are 30% more likely to remember and revisit sites with distinctive favicons, making 
              them a small but mighty component of your online presence.

            <p>
              As web technologies have evolved, so have favicon requirements. In 2025, a complete favicon package 
              includes various sizes and formats to ensure compatibility across all platforms:
            </p>
            
            <table className="min-w-full border border-border mt-4 mb-6">

              </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>
              Additionally, modern websites should include a <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">manifest.json</code> file for PWA support, 
              which references these icons and provides additional metadata for when the site is installed as an app.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Creating Effective Favicons</h2>
            <p>
              When designing a favicon, keep these principles in mind:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Favicons are small - intricate details will be lost</li>
              <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> They should be instantly recognizable, even at small sizes</li>
              <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintain visual alignment with your overall branding</li>
              <li><strong>Distinctiveness:</strong> Ensure they stand out among other tabs and bookmarks</li>
              <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Design with different sizes in mind</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Often, the best favicons are simplified versions of your logo, focusing on the most distinctive elements 
              while removing unnecessary details that won't render well at small sizes.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Implementation Best Practices</h2>
            <p>
              Once you've created your favicon package, proper implementation is crucial. Here's the HTML code you should 
              include in the <code className="bg-muted px-1 rounded">{'<head>'}</code> section of your website:
            </p>
            
            <pre className="p-4 rounded-md bg-muted/50 text-xs overflow-x-auto font-mono my-4">
{`<!-- Basic Favicons -->

            <p>
              After implementation, it's important to test your favicons across different browsers and devices:
