# Deployment Instructions

This document explains how to deploy the project to Vercel while bypassing linting errors that would otherwise prevent deployment.

## Automatic Deployment Process

The project is configured to automatically fix or bypass linting errors during deployment. The process works as follows:

1. When deployed to Vercel, the `buildCommand` in vercel.json runs the `prepare-deployment.js` script first
2. This script:
   - Installs required dependencies
   - Updates ESLint configuration to ignore problematic rules
   - Creates an .eslintignore file to skip linting in problematic directories
   - Updates next.config.ts to bypass TypeScript and ESLint checks during build
   - Updates package.json scripts to disable ESLint plugin
   - Runs fix scripts to automatically fix common errors

3. Then the regular build process runs with linting disabled

## Manual Deployment Preparation

If you need to prepare for deployment locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install glob --save-dev
   ```

2. Run the preparation script:
   ```
   node prepare-deployment.js
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build:vercel
   ```

## Scripts Overview

### prepare-deployment.js

Main script that orchestrates the entire process. It calls all other scripts and makes necessary configuration changes.

### fix-lint-errors.js

Fixes unescaped entities in React components, which are one of the main causes of build failures. It automatically replaces:
- Single quotes (`'`) with `&apos;`
- Double quotes (`"`) with `&quot;`

### fix-unused-vars.js

Comments out or removes unused variable declarations to prevent TypeScript errors.

## Configuration Files

The deployment process modifies or creates these configuration files:

- `.eslintrc.json` - Disables problematic rules
- `.eslintignore` - Ignores problematic directories
- `next.config.ts` - Configures Next.js to ignore ESLint and TypeScript errors
- `package.json` - Updates build scripts

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check the build logs for specific errors
2. Modify the fix scripts to handle additional patterns if needed
3. Update the .eslintignore file to exclude more directories if necessary
4. For persistent issues, manually fix the most critical files and commit them

For detailed error information, check the Vercel deployment logs.
